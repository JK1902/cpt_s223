> **Advanced Data Structures in C++**

__Overview

This project is a collection of implementations and applications of advanced data structures in C++. It was developed as part of the Advanced Data Structures course and utilizes CMake for compilation and build management.

Features

Implementation of various advanced data structures, including:

Red-Black Trees

AVL Trees

B-Trees

Hash Tables

Graphs (Adjacency List and Matrix representations)

Trie

Optimized algorithms for searching, inserting, and deleting elements in each data structure.

Efficient memory management and performance optimizations.

Modular and well-documented C++ code.

Usage

Each data structure is implemented as a separate module.

Run the main executable to interact with different data structures.

Modify the main.cpp file to test specific data structures and their functionalities.
